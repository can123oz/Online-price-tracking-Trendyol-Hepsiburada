HEPSÄ°BURADA AND TRENDYOL PRICE TRACKING.

I created an API with basic crud operations that you can update the products url for tracking price.
After giving urls bot is tracking the prices every at every 10 seconds.
Right now it shows the last prices and logs to the console and integrated with another e-mail bot and notify the user with prices.

It saves the prices and dates every 10 seconds. So you can always check from mongodb or with postman.
